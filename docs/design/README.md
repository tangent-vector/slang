Slang Design and Implementation Notes
=====================================

This directory contains documents that are primarily intended for developers working on the Slang implementation.
They are not indended to be helpful to Slang users.

The [Coding Conventions](coding-conventions.md) document describes the conventions that should be followed in all code added to the Slang project.

The [Interfaces](interfaces.md) document describes the high-level design plan for Slang's interfaces and generics features.

The [Declaration References](decl-refs.md) document is intended to help out developers who are mystified by the heavily used `DeclRef` type in the compiler implementation.
