Model Viewer Example
====================

This example builds on the previous "Hello, World" example to actually load and render a model with very basic surface and light shading.

This example does not make use of any advanced Slang language features, but it provides a starting point for the next few examples which will show how Slang's mechanisms can apply to a rendering application's codebase.
